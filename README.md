## Bioinformatics Software Installation Notes

This repo contains installation information for the bioinformatics software at the icipe cluster. We are using a module system to manage the software in the HPC. 

The installation notes outline how each of the software it was installed, while the modules directly store the module configuration files. 

## updates
There is a basic [nvchecker](https://github.com/lilydjwg/nvchecker) configuration that can help check for new versions of installed applications:

`$ nvchecker .nvchecker/source.ini`
